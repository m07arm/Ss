## My process

### Built with
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JS

 ### What I learned
In this project, I strengthened my knowledge of responsive design. A responsive design needed to be adapted to a variety of screens over time. Hovering and focusing will also enhance the user experience.

### Continued development
I really like doing a project like this that requires patience and gives the highest quality user experience possible. I'll keep focusing on this in the future.
